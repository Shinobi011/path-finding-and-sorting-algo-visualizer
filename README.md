# Path Finding Visualizer Project
A web-based application that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms in action. This tool helps users understand how these algorithms navigate through a grid to find the shortest path between a starting point and an endpoint.

## Introduction

The Pathfinding Visualizer is designed to demonstrate how popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A*, and others work in real-time. It allows users to create obstacles, set start and end points, and visualize how algorithms explore and find the shortest path.

## Features

 -> Interactive Grid: Add start, end, and wall nodes on a grid.
 -> Multiple Algorithms: Visualize various pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, A*, BFS, DFS, and more.
 -> Real-Time Visualization: Watch how each algorithm processes the grid step by step.
 -> Obstacle Creation: Draw walls to create challenges for the algorithms.
 -> Clear and Reset Grid: Easily reset or clear the grid to try different setups.

## Technologies Used

 -> Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
 -> Backend: Node.js (optional if your app has any server-side logic)
 -> Algorithms: JavaScript implementations of various pathfinding algorithms.
