# Path Finding Visualizer Project
A web-based application that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms in action. This tool helps users understand how these algorithms navigate through a grid to find the shortest path between a starting point and an endpoint.

## Introduction

The Pathfinding Visualizer is designed to demonstrate how popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A*, and others work in real-time. It allows users to create obstacles, set start and end points, and visualize how algorithms explore and find the shortest path.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Search
3. Greedy Best-First Search
4. Swarm Algoriihtm
5. Convergent Swarm Algorithm
6. Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm
7. Breadth-first Search
8. Depth-first Search

## Features

 1. Interactive Grid: Add start, end, and wall nodes on a grid.
 2. Real-Time Visualization: Watch how each algorithm processes the grid step by step.
 3. Obstacle Creation: Draw walls to create challenges for the algorithms.
 4. Clear and Reset Grid: Easily reset or clear the grid to try different setups.
 

## Technologies Used

 -> Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
 -> Backend: Node.js
 -> Algorithms: JavaScript implementations of various pathfinding algorithms.
